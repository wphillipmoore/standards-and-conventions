## Overview
RTFM is a forced interruption that indicates a standards violation or a missed
requirement that should have been clear from the governing documentation. Pause
all other work and complete this workflow before resuming normal work.

## Inputs
Collect from the triggering message and session context:
- Optional reason provided after `RTFM` (hint about the violated standards)
- Current branch and git status
- Files touched and action sequence that triggered the violation

## Workflow
1. Pause all other work immediately.
2. Capture the failure context with concrete evidence (branch, git status,
   files touched, and the action sequence that triggered the violation).
3. Identify the violated standards with exact document paths and section
   headings, and state how the response diverged.
4. Ask the user what was unclear or insufficient in the standards; use the
   optional reason to focus the question.
5. Create a GitHub issue in the current repository using the template below.
6. Propose and, when feasible, implement documentation updates that prevent
   recurrence before resuming normal work.
