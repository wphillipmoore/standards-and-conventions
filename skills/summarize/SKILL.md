## Overview
Produce a concise, structured summary using the canonical protocol for the
selected mode. Preserve outcomes, reasoning, and evidence without adding
external knowledge.

## Mode selection
Select the mode in this order:
1. If the user explicitly specifies a mode, follow it.
2. If the user uses `Enter SOC` or `End SOC`, use **soc** mode.
3. If the request centers on decisions, rationale, or alternatives, use
   **decisions** mode.
4. If the request centers on actions taken, system changes, or outcomes, use
   **operations** mode.
5. If multiple modes plausibly apply, ask the minimum clarification question:
   "Which mode: decisions, operations, or soc?"

## Common rules
- Base the summary only on the provided input record.
- Do not add external facts, assumptions, or inferred details.
- Call out missing or ambiguous information explicitly.
- Preserve sequence when the order of events matters.
- Keep the output concise and non-narrative.

## Mode: decisions
Follow the Summarize Decisions Protocol.
- Required section order: Results, Reasoning, Options Not Chosen.
- Label implicitly converged decisions as **implicit**.
- Include optional sections only when present in the input.

## Mode: operations
Follow the Summarize Operations Protocol.
- Required section order: Actions Taken, Outcomes and Status, Problems
  Encountered and Solved, Problems Unresolved, Changes and Artifacts, Follow-up
  Work and New Issues.
- Capture evidence for command-driven actions (commands + minimal output).
- Include timestamps when available; state when none were provided.
- Redact secrets or sensitive data and note the redaction.

## Mode: soc
Follow the Summarize Stream of Consciousness Protocol.
- `Enter SOC` begins capture mode; acknowledge capture activation.
- During SOC capture, record input verbatim and do not summarize or interpret.
- `End SOC` ends capture mode and triggers the structured summary.
- If SOC is not closed with `End SOC`, do not produce a summary.
